These can settings that need to be made or tips that we communicate during the live sessions. \n\nIf you have a request, let us know and we will add guidance here.\n\n## Switch pipe operator\n\nBy default, R uses `%>%` as the pipe operator from the `magrittr` package. Since R 4.1.0, the pipe operator is also available as `|>` without loading any packages. The `|>` operator is recommended to be used instead of `%>%`.\n\nTo switch to the native pipe operator, follow these steps:\n\n1. Open your project on Posit Cloud\n2. On the menu bar of RStudio, click on `Tools` > `Global Options...` (see @fig-global-options)\n3. On the left panel, click on `Code`\n4. On the right panel, select the 4th check-box from the top next to 'Use native pipe operator, |> (requires R 4.1+) (see @fig-native-pipe)\n5. Click on `Apply` and `OK`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![RStudio Global Options](images/rstudio-tools-global-options.png){#fig-global-options width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![RStudio Code Options](images/rstudio-code-native-pipe.png){#fig-native-pipe width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n",
