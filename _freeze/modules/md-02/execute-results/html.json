This week is all about exploring data with `ggplot2` R package. We will also learn about the data science lifecycle. \n\n## {{< fa bullseye >}} Learning Objectives\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n1. Learners can list the six elements of the data science lifecycle.\n2. Learners can describe the four main aesthetic mappings that can be used to visualise data using the ggplot2 R Package.\n3. Learners can control the colour scaling applied to a plot using colour as an aesthetic mapping.\n4. Learners can compare three different geoms (bar/col, histogram, point) and their use case.\n:::\n\n\n## {{< fa display >}} Slides\n\n- In preparation\n\n## {{< fa book >}} Readings\n\n1.
