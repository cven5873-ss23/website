The final two weeks are reserved for working on the report. \n\n\n## {{< fa bullseye >}} Learning Objectives\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n1. Learners can apply the skills obtained during the course to write a short data analysis project report.\n\n\n## {{< fa code >}} GitHub repository\n\nA repository for each student is established. This repository contains self-identified data that was shared in week 3 of the course. Some data cleaning steps are performed by the course instructor, so that each student has a tidy dataset to work with.\n\nThe repository further contains an empty Quarto file (report.qmd), which students must use to write their report. A list of graded items was prepared to guide students in writing the report.\n\n## {{< fa pen-clip >}} GitHub issue tracker\n\nThe GitHub issue tracker of each student's capstone project repository is used to communicate and ask questions about the Capstone Project report.\n\n## {{< fa calendar-check >}} Submission due date\n\nThe due date for submission of the report is **Friday, 28th July**. Any commits after the due date will not be counted against the graded items. \n\n## {{< fa list-check >}} Graded items\n\n@tbl-grading-items is a detailed list of items for grading of the capstone project report are presented. The sum of points is 100 and spread over technical and intellectual items as presented in @tbl-grading-categories.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-grading-items .cell tbl-cap='List of items and points for grading of the capstone project report.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|category     |items                                                                                                                                                                | points|\n|:------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------:|\n|technical    |The report renders without errors to HTML format and contains at least four chapters of heading level 1 that are named: Introduction, Methods, Results, Conclusions. |     10|\n|technical    |YAML header of report has title, author, date, and table of contents that are correctly displayed in the compiled HTML output.                                       |      8|\n|technical    |Warnings are hidden from the compiled output, but code is shown in the compiled output.                                                                              |      2|\n|technical    |The report has at least two data visualisations.                                                                                                                     |     20|\n|technical    |Each data visualisation has edited human-readable labels (e.g. axis labels, legend title).                                                                           |      4|\n|technical    |Each data visualisation applies at least of once scaling function (e.g. color/fill, axes).                                                                           |      4|\n|technical    |Each data visualisation has a label defined in the code-chunk options.                                                                                               |      4|\n|technical    |Each data visualisation has a caption defined in the code-chunk options.                                                                                             |      4|\n|technical    |Each data visualisation has an alternative text that describes what type of visualisation it is and trends or learnings from the visualisation.                      |      4|\n|technical    |Each data visualisation is cross-referenced in the narrative using the defined label from the code-chunk options.                                                    |      4|\n|technical    |The report has at least one table with summary statistics (e.g. count, mean, median, standard deviation, etc.)                                                       |      8|\n|technical    |Each table is formatted in the rendered output using a function taught during the course (e.g. kable() function or gt() function)                                    |      2|\n|technical    |Each table has a label defined in the code-chunk options.                                                                                                            |      2|\n|technical    |Each table has a caption defined in the code-chunk options.                                                                                                          |      2|\n|technical    |Each table is cross-referenced in the narrative using the defined label from the code-chunk options.                                                                 |      2|\n|intellectual |Introduction section with 3 to 5 sentences introduces the context within which the data was created.                                                                 |      5|\n|intellectual |Methods section describes in 3 to 5 sentences how the data was obtained.                                                                                             |      5|\n|intellectual |Figures and tables in Results section are interpreted with 2 to 3 sentences each.                                                                                    |      5|\n|intellectual |Conclusions concisely summarize findings in a bullet point format.                                                                                                   |      5|\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {#tbl-grading-categories .cell tbl-cap='Sum of points for technical and intellectual part of report.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|category     |description                                                                   | points|\n|:------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------:|\n|intellectual |This item is part of the intellectual framing of the capstone project report. |     20|\n|technical    |This item is a technical part of the capstone project report.                 |     80|\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## {{< fa terminal >}} Get started\n\n1.
