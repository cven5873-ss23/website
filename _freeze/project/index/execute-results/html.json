The final two weeks are reserved for working on the report. \n\n## GitHub repository\n\nA repository for each student is established. This repository contains self-identified data that was shared in week 3 of the course. Some data cleaning steps are performed by the course instructor, so that each student has a tidy dataset to work with.\n\nThe repository further contains an empty Quarto file (report.qmd), which students must use to write their report. A list of graded items was prepared to guide students in writing the report.\n\n## Graded items\n\n@tbl-grading-items is a detailed list of items for grading of the capstone project report are presented. The sum of points is 100 and spread over technical and intellectual items as presented in @tbl-grading-categories.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-grading-items .cell tbl-cap='List of items and points for grading of
