Complete them by Friday, 9th June to receive the points for this assignment.\n\nPrepare questions\nüìñ Read the Course Overview and pay special attention to the sections Assignments, Grading scheme, and Late Work. Prepare at least one question.\n\n\nGet an account for GitHub\nTo set up an account on GitHub, follow these general steps:\n\nGo to the GitHub website at https://github.com/.\nClick on the ‚ÄúSign up‚Äù button on the top right corner of the page.\nEnter your preferred username, email address, and password in the provided fields.\nChoose whether you want to receive updates and announcements via email.\nComplete the verification process by solving a puzzle and entering a verification code sent to your email.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsername advice from: Happy Git and GitHub for the useR\n\n\n\nYou will be able to upgrade to a paid level of service, apply discounts, join organizations, etc. in the future, so don‚Äôt fret about any of that now. Except your username. You might want to give that some thought.\nA few tips, which sadly tend to contradict each other:\n\nIncorporate your actual name! People like to know who they‚Äôre dealing with. Also makes your username easier for people to guess or remember.\nReuse your username from other contexts, e.g., Twitter or Slack. But, of course, someone with no GitHub activity will probably be squatting on that.\nPick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.\nShorter is better than longer.\nBe as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. In some settings GitHub auto-completes or suggests usernames.\nMake it timeless. Don‚Äôt highlight your current university, employer, or place of residence, e.g.¬†JennyFromTheBlock.\nAvoid words laden with special meaning in programming.\nAvoid the use of upper vs.¬†lower case to separate words. We highly recommend all lowercase. GitHub treats usernames in a case insensitive way, but using all lowercase is kinder to people doing downstream regular expression work with usernames, in various languages. A better strategy for word separation is to use a hyphen -.\n\nYou can change your username later, but better to get this right the first time.\n\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/changing-your-github-username/\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/what-happens-when-i-change-my-username/\n\n\n\n\n\nLog into Posit Cloud with GitHub account\nHere are the instructions to login to Posit Cloud using a GitHub account:\n\nGo to the Posit Cloud Sign Up page: https://login.posit.cloud/register\nClick on the ‚ÄúSign Up with GitHub‚Äù button.\nEnter your GitHub username and password when prompted.\nIf this is your first time logging in to Posit Cloud with your GitHub account, you will be prompted to authorize Posit Cloud to access your GitHub account information.\nOnce you have authorized access, you will be redirected back to the Posit Cloud website and logged in to your account.\n\nNote that you will need to have a GitHub account in order to use this login method. If you do not have a GitHub account, you will need to create one before you can log in to Posit Cloud.\n\n\nJoin the course workspace on Posit Cloud\n\nOpen this link: https://posit.cloud/spaces/381404/join?access_code=5uSGb1oKtIngQmhbsM-th5J23j2SqMU2oIuX0go-\n\n\n\nSet up a GitHub Personal Access Token\nHere are the step-by-step instructions to set up a GitHub personal access token:\n\nLog in to your GitHub account.\nClick on your profile picture in the top-right corner of the page.\nSelect ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù from the dropdown menu.\nIn the left sidebar, click on ‚ÄúDeveloper settings‚Äù.\nClick on ‚ÄúPersonal access tokens‚Äù.\nClick on ‚ÄúTokens (classic)‚Äù.\nClick on ‚ÄúGenerate new token‚Äù and from the dropdown menu select ‚ÄúGenerate new token (classic)‚Äù.\nIn the ‚ÄúNote‚Äù field, give your token the name: GITHUB_PAT\nUnder Expiration, select ‚ÄúNo expiration‚Äù\nUnder ‚ÄúSelect scopes‚Äù, select: repo, workflow, user\nClick on ‚ÄúGenerate token‚Äù.\nYour personal access token will be displayed on the screen.

Lectures will be delivered through participatory live coding for students to learn how to write code in code-along exercises. We will use publicly available data related to waste management, air quality, and sanitation. Students will learn how to help themselves and others to build upon the obtained skills to apply them to their data analysis projects.\nTopics include:\n\nThe data science life-cycle\nData organization in spreadsheets\nExploratory data analysis using visualization\nConcept of tidy data and data tidying\nData transformation and descriptive statistics\nData communication using the Quarto open-source scientific and technical publishing system\n\n\n\nLearning Goals\n\nBe able to use a common set of data science tools (R, RStudio IDE, Git, GitHub, tidyverse, Quarto) to illustrate and communicate the utility of solutions for water, sanitation, air quality, and global health.\nLearn to use the Quarto file format and the RStudio IDE visual editing mode to produce scholarly documents with citations, footnotes, cross-references, figures, and tables.\n\n\n\nTextbooks and Materials\nWe will rely entirely on open source and open access material for this course. We will use ‚ÄúR for Data Science‚Äù by Hadley Wickham, and ‚ÄúTidyverse Skills for Data Science‚Äù by Carrie Wright, Shannon E. Ellis, Stephanie C. Hicks and Roger D. Peng, as complementary reading and learning material for this course. Additional readings will consist of blog posts, journal articles, and reports. All required readings and class material will be provided through this website.\n\n\nCourse Calendar\n\n\n\n\n\ndate\nweek\ntopic\nnote\n\n\n\n\n05 June 2023\n1\nGet ready for the course\nno lecture\n\n\n12 June 2023\n2\nWelcome! & Data Science Life-cycle\nlecture 1\n\n\n19 June 2023\n3\nExploratory data analysis using visualization & Data organization in spreadsheets\nlecture 2\n\n\n26 June 2023\n4\nData transformation and descriptive statistics\nlecture 3\n\n\n03 July 2023\n5\nConcept of tidy data, vectors and pivoting\nlecture 4\n\n\n10 July 2023\n6\nJoining data & data communication using Quarto\nlecture 5\n\n\n17 July 2023\n7\nCapstone Project Submission\nno lecture\n\n\n24 July 2023\n8\nExam\nno lecture\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeekly Structure\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonday\nLecture\n\n\nTuesday\n\n\n\nWednesday\nFeedback (grading) on assignments from previous week\n\n\nThursday\nStudent hours on Zoom (10 am to 12 pm CEST)\n\n\nFriday\nHomework assignment and learning reflection are due\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignments\nHomework assignments: Each week will have at least one homework assignment. All assignments, but those for Week 1 are delivered as Quarto documents with instructions and some sample code. Students are required to submit their work through GitHub. Homework assignments are graded as pass/fail (100 points).\nReadings/Learning reflections: Additional readings will be provided. Some are required, others are optional. Students will be asked to write 100 word reflections on the material that they have learned. These reflections are delivered as Quarto documents and graded as pass/fail (100 points). Students are required to submit their work through GitHub.\nCapstone Project: A graded capstone project provides students with an opportunity to apply their skills and techniques to real-world data sets. Detailed instructions and a grading rubric for the capstone project will be provided during the course. The project will be delivered as Quarto documents and graded with an achieved number of points out 100 points. Students are required to submit their work through GitHub.\nExam: There is a practical 2-hour exam, which assesses the technical skills (using R tidyverse and Quarto) taught during the course. It contains programming exercises using the R programming language and you can use any material that you want. The success of the exam depends on the effort put into the homework assignments and capstone project. The exam will be written using Quarto documents and graded as pass/fail (100 points). Students will not submit their work through GitHub.\n\n\nAttendance\nWe hope you can participate in all classes. Class participation is an essential component for successful completion of this course. If you have a valid reason to miss a class, we expect you to inform us before the beginning of the class.\n\n\nGrading scheme\nYour overall course grade will be comprised of the following components, and their weights:\n\nHomework assignments: 40 percent\nLearning reflections: 20 percent\nCapstone Project: 20 percent\nExam: 20 percent\n\nGrades will be recorded in Canvas throughout the semester. Homework assignments and learning reflections receive a pass/fail only (100 points). The Capstone Project and Exam receive a number of points out of 100. At the end of the term, the scores on all assignments are weighted by the percentages given above to determine a semester score. Student grades will be determined as follows based on their score rounded to the nearest single decimal place:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Conversion from percent to grades.\n    \n    \n    \n      grade\n      percent\n    \n  \n  \n    A+\n97\n    A\n93\n    A-\n90\n    B+\n87\n    B\n83\n    B-\n80\n    C+\n77\n    C\n73\n    C-\n70\n    D+\n67\n    D\n63\n    D-\n60\n    F\n0\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLate work, extensions, and special circumstances\nDue dates are set and all work is due on the stated date. This helps students to keep pace through the course and allow staff to return marks and feedback timely. Submission on the due date might not always be possible when something gets in the way. We drop the lowest score for each of the assignments or learning reflections. That means you can miss one assignment or learning reflection and still achieve maximum score.\nSpecial circumstances\nIf you have a documented reason for why you are unable to to complete an assignment in the course, the reason will be assessed at the end of the course by the course committee.\n\n\nClassroom behavior\nBoth students and faculty are responsible for maintaining an appropriate learning environment in all instructional settings, whether in person, remote or online. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with race, color, national origin, sex, pregnancy, age, disability, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, veteran status, political affiliation or political philosophy. For more information, see the policies on classroom behavior and the Student Conduct & Conflict Resolution policies.\n\n\nPreferred student names and pronouns\nCU Boulder recognizes that students‚Äô legal information doesn‚Äôt always align with how they identify. Students may update their preferred names and pronouns via the student portal; those preferred names and pronouns are listed on instructors‚Äô class rosters. In the absence of such updates, the name that appears on the class roster is the student‚Äôs legal name.\n\n\nHonor code\nAll students enrolled in a University of Colorado Boulder course are responsible for knowing and adhering to the Honor Code academic integrity policy. Violations of the Honor Code may include, but are not limited to: plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, lying, bribery, threat, unauthorized access to academic materials, clicker fraud, submitting the same or similar work in more than one course without permission from all course instructors involved, and aiding academic dishonesty. All incidents of academic misconduct will be reported to the Honor Code (honor@colorado.edu); 303-492-5550). Students found responsible for violating the academic integrity policy will be subject to nonacademic sanctions from the Honor Code as well as academic sanctions from the faculty member. Additional information regarding the Honor Code academic integrity policy can be found on the Honor Code website.\n\n\nSexual misconduct, discrimintation, harassment and/or related retaliation\nCU Boulder is committed to fostering an inclusive and welcoming learning, working, and living environment. The university will not tolerate acts of sexual misconduct (harassment, exploitation, and assault), intimate partner violence (dating or domestic violence), stalking, or protected-class discrimination or harassment by or against members of our community. Individuals who believe they have been subject to misconduct or retaliatory actions for reporting a concern should contact the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance (OIEC) at 303-492-2127 or email cureport@colorado.edu. Information about university policies, reporting options, and the support resources can be found on the OIEC website.\nPlease know that faculty and graduate instructors have a responsibility to inform OIEC when they are made aware of incidents of sexual misconduct, dating and domestic violence, stalking, discrimination, harassment and/or related retaliation, to ensure that individuals impacted receive information about their rights, support resources, and reporting options. To learn more about reporting and support options for a variety of concerns, visit Don‚Äôt Ignore It."
