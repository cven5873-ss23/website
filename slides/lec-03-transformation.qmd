# Data Organisation in Spreadsheets {background-color="#0F4C81"}

## Think, Pair, Share

:::{.callout-note}
## Questions
1. Why should you not leave a blank cell in a spreadsheet used for data collection?
2. Which of the 12 rules for data organization was the least comprehensible to you?
:::

- **Think** for 2 minutes
- **Pair** with in break-out rooms for 4 minutes
- **Share** your answer with the class


```{r, echo = FALSE}

countdown(
  minutes = 2, seconds = 0,
  left = 0, right = 0,
  padding = "10px", margin = "5%",
  font_size = "2em"
)

```

## Learning Objectives (for this week)

```{r}

lobj1 <- readr::read_csv(here::here("data/tbl-02-cven5837-ss23-learning-objectives.csv")) |>
  dplyr::filter(week == params$week) |>
  dplyr::pull(learning_objectives)

```

1. `r lobj1[1]`

# Data wrangling with dplyr  {background-color="#0F4C81"}

## A grammar of data wrangling... {.smaller}

... based on the concepts of functions as verbs that manipulate data frames

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

```{r dplyr-part-of-tidyverse, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%", caption = "dplyr is part of the tidyverse"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lec-03/dplyr-part-of-tidyverse.png")
```

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

- `select`: pick columns by name
- `arrange`: reorder rows
- `slice`: chooses rows based on location
- `filter`: pick rows matching criteria
- `relocate`: changes the order of the columns
- `mutate`: add new variables
- `summarise`: reduce variables to values
- `group_by`: for grouped operations
- ... (many more)

## dplyr rules

Rules of `dplyr` functions:

::: {.incremental}

- First argument is always a data frame
- Subsequent arguments say what to do with that data frame
- Always return a data frame  
- Don't modify in place

# Pair Programming Exercise {background-color="#0F4C81"}

## Pair Programming Exercises 

- Two learners work together in a break out session
- One person (the driver) shares the screen and does the typing
- The other person (the navigator) offers comments and suggestions
- Roles get switched
