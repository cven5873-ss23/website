::: notes
-   It is traightforward in Quarto to move between output formats
-   As an educator, there are two things that are important to me
    -   reproducibility, and
    -   ease of transitiion between output formats
-   I am using Quarto for everything, and it's finally the tool let's me go from one output type to anoher without the to change anything by the YAML metadata

For example, here are common things I produce

--\> a lesson in document form <br> --\> the same content in presentation form <br> --\> the same content on a page in a website,

and you can see that all that needed to change going between these formats is a few lines in the yaml.

No slide breaks to remove, no citation style to change, no headings to re-level. This ease of transition has freed up time to focus my time on content, and that, folks, is the dream!
