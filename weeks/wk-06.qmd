## {{< fa code >}} Homework assignment 

### Practice

This week's homework programming assignment is an assignment with four sections, which let you practice the functions you have learned during the course. The assigment is contained in a sub-folder of week 5 titled "hw-05a-practice".

### Slides

This part of the homework programming assignment does not have a starter file. It is your task to create this file yourself. 

1. Create a new Quarto file by navigating to the menu: File -> New File -> Quarto Presentation 
2. Add a title and author, and use the default Reveal JS format
3. Save the file in "course-material/wk-05/slides" with the name index.qmd
4. Click Render and inspect the output in the Presentation pane on the bottom right
5. Delete all content besides the YAML header (at the top of the document)
6. Use your own creativity and the [Quarto Guide for Revealjs slides](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) to prepare a minimum of five slides. 
7. Add the line `self-contained: true` to the YAML header
8. Render the slides
9. Export (download) the "slides" directory as "slides.zip" from RStudio Cloud and store the ZIP file on your computer
10. Navigate to the folder where you stored the "slides.zip" file and unzip the compressed directory
11. Log into your Netlifly account you created during class
12. Upload the "slides" directory to Netlifly
13. Wait until the site has been deployed
14. Share the created link that shows your slides with the course instructor
